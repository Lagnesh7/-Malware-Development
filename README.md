# Malware-Development
This project involves the development of malware for Windows operating systems using C, C++, and assembly language. The focus is on creating sophisticated malware with advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection by anti-virus software.

## Responsibilities
- Develop malware for Windows platforms using C, C++, and assembly language.
- Implement various cryptography algorithms like **AES and XOR operation** to encrypt shellcode and payloads to prevent detection by anti-virus software.
- Research and implement evasion techniques to bypass security mechanisms and remain undetected on target systems.

## Skills Used
- Proficiency in C, C++, and assembly language programming.
- Knowledge of Windows internals and system programming.
- Understanding of cryptography algorithms and encryption techniques.
- Familiarity with reverse engineering and malware analysis tools.
- Strong problem-solving and debugging skills.

## Coverage
### Shellcode Execution

1. **Basic Approch**: Allocate memory space in the current process, copy the shellcode into the allocated memory space, and modify the memory space permission to "read-execute" to allow execution of the shellcode.Create a thread to execute the shellcode from the allocated memory space.
2. **EnumChildWindows Approach**: Utilizes the EnumChildWindows function to enumerate all child windows associated with a specified parent window.

3. **EnumDesktopsW Approach**: Utilizes the EnumDesktopsW function to enumerate all desktops in the window station associated with the calling process.

4. **EnumWindows Approach**: Utilizes the EnumWindows function to enumerate all top-level windows on the screen by passing the handle to each window, in turn, to an application-defined callback function.

5. **Time Delay-based Execution**: Implements a time delay-based execution approach to bypass antivirus detection. This involves introducing time delays or sleeps in the execution flow to evade detection by antivirus software.

### Shellcode Encryption
1. **AES Encryption and Decryption**: Utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption techniques to encode shellcode. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data. Encrypting shellcode with AES helps evade detection by antivirus software.

2. **XOR Encryption and Decryption**: Implements XOR (Exclusive OR) encryption and decryption techniques for shellcode. XOR is a simple bitwise operation that can be used for encryption and decryption. XORing shellcode with a key helps obfuscate its contents and evade antivirus detection.

### Process Injection
1. Process Injection: Process injection is a technique used in software exploitation and security research to execute arbitrary code within the context of another process.This code snippet demonstrates process injection on the Windows platform using the Windows API functions. It involves injecting shellcode into a target process to execute arbitrary code.
